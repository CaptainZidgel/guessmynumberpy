# guessmynumber
I bought a few books in a Humble Bundle, among which were Learn Java the Easy Way and Automate the Boring Stuff with Python.
Learn Java had an example program about guessing your number.
Well as I was reading through Automate the Boring Stuff, wouldnt'cha know it, it had the gosh darn same kind of example program!
So I skipped the book's guides and tried to use its previous instructions to see if I could recreate the program, sans GUI.


not that anyone's gonna read this but like
